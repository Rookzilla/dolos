### Dolos: Adventure Game

#### Project Overview
Welcome to the internal project README for Dolos, an action-adventure game currently under development.
Dolos is an game theory AI project designed to test the implementation of 3D sightlines using dot-product angles and character interaction from scripted sequences.

The working model is 3D camera control and specific shaders based on the users position on the X and Z axis (The world roll is configured at 90 degrees.)
